go to your folder in your terminalrun:

  npm install
Then need build the app using "parcel" in your terminal with this command

parcel build index.html --public-url ./
then go to /dist folder inside of cardsPlayerModule and open index.html

  ./dist/index.html
i have a issue to show img in parcel but nothing to do with my code so if you open the folder /dist should be fine and works like in localhost

normarly work if you go to localhost:1234, but there you now see any img right now.
